### Upgrading NixOS

https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-upgrading

```sh
# To see which NixOS channel youâ€™re subscribed to, run the following as root:
sudo nix-channel --list | grep nixos
# > nixos https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-24.05

# To switch to a different NixOS channel, do... (Be sure to include the nixos parameter at the end.) For instance, to use the NixOS 25.05 stable channel:
sudo nix-channel --add https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-25.05 nixos

# You can then upgrade NixOS to the latest version in your chosen channel by running
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --upgrade --flake .#nyx

# Then run the common commands for upgrading flake etc.
```
